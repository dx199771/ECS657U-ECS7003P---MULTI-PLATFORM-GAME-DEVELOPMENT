For this assignment you need to design and implement a 2D or 3D game in Unity for a desktop platform (Windows/Linux/OSX). You have a considerable degree of freedom in what you make, as long as it meets the criteria below. Possible examples include a 3D shooter, a racing game, a flight/spaceship simulator, or a platformer. It can be your own interpretation of an existing game.

The course mark breakdown is divided as follows. For UG students (enrolled in ECS657U):

Game Prototype: 20%
Final Game: 80%
For PG students (enrolled in ECS7003P):

Game Prototype: 20%
Final Game: 70%
Case Study: 10%


Note on Third Party Code/Assets: Extensive use of third party libraries is not allowed and any code segments based on someone else's code (e.g., if your code has been inspired by some source found online) has to be properly acknowledged and referenced. You should do the same for any free assets used such as textures, 3D models, sprites, audio, etc. It is absolutely forbidden to use non-free resources from the Unity Asset Store or from other sites. It is also forbidden to submit one of the weekly lab assignments, or extensions of those. The game must be substantially different than the ones from the labs and lectures.

Assignments are made in groups of 3 students. Please use the Group Selection tool to self-organize yourselves in groups. Students not in groups will be randomly assigned among themselves or to groups formed of less than 3 students.
